<p>  Since time has begun people have been bullying each other either for fun, gain or because they were bored. As time has advanced we have come up with many laws that prevent people taking bullying people to far as to much bully is not good for the anybody's self esteem. Definitions of bullying has changed over the years as people have become more aware of what it does to a person's self-esteem. dictionary.com (n.d.) defines bullying as: " a blustering, quarrelsome, overbearing person who habitually badgers and intimidates smaller or weaker people". While I agree that this definition is correct cyber-bullying is different because it is not face to face. It is much easier to bully someone that is facing a computer screen then one that is facing another human. This is why it is so easy to do it while not even thinking because all we see is a username and a picture that might not even  be that person. It can also be easily covered up because it can be deleted or lost in years of posts, blogs and comments. Even people that are in contact with each other in real life could be bullying each other in the virtual world. When I used to play on Xbox live there were things that some of my friends and I did to other people in order to entertain ourselves that I would consider cyber-bullying. For example we would play Minecraft with a random person and then we would tell them that we could make something cool and tell them to go far away so we could destroy there "world". After we were done destroying everything we would tell them to save so that the change was permanent. It is very easy to get caught up  in Cyber-bullying just for one's own entertainment.

<p> According to the Do Something.org (n.d.) This is a very high number in terms of how many people have been bullied online. If you think about how many teens that there are in the United States alone that is about 17,992,920 (ACT for Youth Center of Excellence, 2012) that have been Cyber Bullied in the United States. This in the short term makes teens that are trying to fit in, very depressed. The matter is made worse when you see that 80% of teens use cell phones regularly (Do Something.org (n.d.)).This opens up the gate way for people to take out there anger on others without seeing a face since so many teens have a cell phone. In the long term I don't think that it is that big of a deal because everybody grows up and forgives ( at least I hope so). But the worst case scenario is someone committing suicide. It is the sad but all too true truth that happens in this world. It is very hard to stop because as I said before it is very hard to prove. 
</p>
<p>Something has to be done about this problem. I think that more awareness is known now and parents now know more about how to deal with something like that. But there is still a problem because it is in the virtual world. A lot of people don't think that the virtual can affect the real world, so cyber-bullying isn't taken as seriously as face to face bullying because it can be dealt with on the spot. I think that the virtual age took everybody by storm and people weren't prepared for how it was going to be used and how cruel people would be to each other. And like most new things it wasn't regulated in the hopes that it could regulate itself, but sadly like everything else in history the few people that make something bad ruin it for everyone.

<p> Cyber bullying is usually suffered in silence. This is because of the notion that the victim doesn't have to be on the social media sites, but even if the person stops going on the social media sites the bullying can still continue.
